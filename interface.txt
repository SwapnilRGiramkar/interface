*Interface-->
**Interface are the member/Components in java which are used to achieve pure abstraction.
**Concrete non-static methods are not-allowed in Interface.
-Interface are used to achieve multiple Inheritance in java.

***Members that can be created in interface-->
1)We can create only public Non-Static abstract method.
2)Any variable decalred in a interface is by default public static and final.
3)Concrete Non-Static methods are not allowed.
4)Constructors are Not allowed.

*Any member in a interface by default public it is not necessary for a programmer to prefix public modifier.
*All Non-Static method are by default public and abstract in a interface ,therefore it is not necessary for a programmer to prefix 
 public modifier.
 *from jdk 1.8 onwards public static concrete methods are allowed in interface.
 *default Non-Static concrete methods are allowed in interface.

 ****Note-->
 1)if we want to inheritance between two classes or two interfaces we used extends keyward.
 2)if we want to inheritance between class and interface we used implements keyword.

 **We cannot have public non-static method of an interface.
 **We cannot have any Constructors in interface.
 **Initilizers are like static block or non-static block are not allowed .
 **An inerface cannot be Instanciated.
 **An interface can inherited another interface.
 **Class can inherited another interface.
 **Inheritance cannot inherit class (Concrete members of class not allowed in interface).
